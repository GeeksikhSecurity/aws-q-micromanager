## Inspiration

AWS Q MicroManager is inspired by [RooCodeMicroManager](https://github.com/adamwlarson/RooCodeMicroManager), created by Adam Larson ([@adamwlarson](https://github.com/adamwlarson)).

The core concept of intelligent task orchestration and specialized AI modes was adapted from Adam's original work with RooCode, reimagined for use with AWS Q Developer.

## Key Adaptations

- Modified prompt system to work with AWS Q Developer's saved prompts
- Adjusted mode definitions to align with AWS Q capabilities
- Updated model recommendations to prioritize AWS Q Developer
- Simplified installation process for AWS Q integration

We extend our gratitude to Adam Larson for the innovative approach to AI task orchestration that inspired this project.
